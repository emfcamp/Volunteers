- Call for Experienced Volunteers -

Firstly, thank-you for your interest in EMFCamp and wanting to help make this extraordinary event possible. EMFCamp is only possible through having a passionate and active community, willing to build something awesome.

We are actively looking for volunteers to help with the event. We need people to help run the bars, offer advice to visitors, run the main gate and all manner of other tasks. We are particularly keen to hear from people with specific skills they can bring to the event, such as first aid training, bar skills and such.

We'll be looking after you throughout the event. If you are on a long shift, we'll provide food tokens and our special back-stage area will have plenty of tea and coffee on demand. But most important of all, you'll have the unique experience and joy of making the first UK Hack Camp possible.


At EMFCamp, we'll be running shifts of 3 hours, though for some of the specialist roles, different times apply. We need people to staff and supervise the following roles. If you want to be a part of what will be an excellent camp, please email ben@emfcamp.org with your name, relevant experience and your availability. 


- Bar Staff -

We will be having bars on site, open from 11am to 11pm and we need people there to run them. If you feel you can serve drinks to hackers then let us know. We need people who are willing to operate the challenge 25 policy.

- Safety and Security - 

To hold a large camp, we do have to look after the space and our people. We need some hardy volunteers to walk around the site and make sure people are safe. We are particularly interested in people with security experience in any form. EMFCamp is open to under 18s so we also require people with pastoral experience. We need volunteer with ECRBs so if you have an up-to-date ECRB, we'd love to hear from you.

- First Aid - 

We are providing basic first aid cover for the event. This role requires people to be 'on-call' and 'roaming the site' for long periods of time, but this is a vital and rewarding role. If you have a St Johns Ambulance Qualification or equivalent, a 3-4 day first aid at work certificate or equivalent, we'd very much like to hear from you. Free tickets to the event are provided to the first aid team, along with equipment.

- Main Gate - 

Volunteers are needed to staff the gate whilst we are allowing people on site. We need people to hand out wristbands and check to see people have tickets.

- Information Desk -

Campers will need to know what is going on and where. The information desk is the place to go and we need knowledgeable people to run this.
