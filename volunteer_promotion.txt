- Introduction -

Firstly, thankyou for your interest in EMFCamp and wanting to help make this extraordinary event possible. EMFCamp is only possible through having a passionate and active community, willing to build something awesome.

We are actively looking fo volunteers to help with the event. We need people to help run the bars, offer advice to visitors, run the main gate and all manner of other tasks. We'd like volunters to donate at least 3 hours of their time over the course of the camp. If you feel you can spend more time helping make this event great, please do so. 

We'll be looking after you throughout the event. If you are on a long shift, we'll provide food tokens and our special back-stage area will have plenty of tea and coffee on demand. But most important of all, you'll have the unique experience and joy of making the first UK Hack Camp possible.

The volunteer system runs on 3 hour shifts. We'd like to rotate people around each of the duties so no-one ends up staying in the smae place for too long. If you are a night-owl, please apply for the later shifts. If you enjoy barwork and helping speakers, please apply for both. 

We need people to fill the following roles. Throughout the camp we'll be swapping people around the various roles so no-one gets bored. 


- Bar Staff -

We will be having bars on site, open from 11am to 11pm and we need people there to run them. If you feel you can serve drinks to hackers then let us know.

- Car Park Stewards -

People will be arriving by car, train and minibus throughout the weekend. We need people to point out where cars can be parked and where the main entrance is.

- Main Gate - 

Volunteers are needed to staff the gate whilst we are allowing people on site. We need people to hand out wristbands and check to see people have tickets. 

- Speaker Helpers -

We'll be having workshops and talks throughout the weekend at our camp. If you have any experience with AV or venues, we need your help to make sure our speakers are happy. 

- Safety and Security - 

To hold a large camp, we do have to look after the space and our people. We need some hardy volunteers to walk around the site and make sure people are safe.

- Information Desk -

Campers will need to know what is going on and where. The information desk is the place to go and we need knowledgeable people to run this.


We also want to hear from people with first aid qualifications, minibus drivers and anyone who has had significant festival experience.


For these who have more time to spend, we need help with setting up and tearing down. We need volunteers to help put up fences, setup marquees and bars and generally be there to help build the camp. It's a unique challenge and will be a lot of fun.
